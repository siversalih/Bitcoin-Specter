# Bitcoin Specter
Bitcoin Analyzer Tool for Coinbase/GDAX

I just finished building this tool, exactly yesterday (4/25), but I have been working on writing the script for about a week (4/19) and I have to say I've just made a dollar now in just less than an hour. Yes, one dollar in less than an hour and this is without any experience in bitcoin, stock investment, or any experience in data analytics. So, this is acctually an easy tool for anyone to use and if you need to make money on bitcoin.

Now to run the script, these are the libraries you need:
- gdax/coinbase
- matplotlib
- scipy
- numpy
- csv
